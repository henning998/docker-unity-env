# docker-unity-env
Docker-unity-env uses Docker to run the 2DJumper environment. 2DJumper is a submodule of docker-unity-env, and the start.py file is always run when the Docker container starts up. This allows users to easily run and manage the 2DJumper environment using Docker.
## Why docker
Using Docker to run the 2DJumper environment has several benefits. The main benefit is it allows users to easily run and manage the environment without having to install and configure all of the necessary dependencies on their local machine. Additionally, Docker allows users to run multiple instances of the 2DJumper environment on the same machine. This is useful for testing and developing the scalability and optimizing the parallel worker
